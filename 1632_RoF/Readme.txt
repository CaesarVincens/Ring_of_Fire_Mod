1632 - The Ring of Fire brings the world of Eric Flint's 1632 series to Hearts of Iron IV.

Play an alternate history set in the middle of the Thirty Years war where a town from the USA in the year 2000 has been transported to Germany in 1631. Play as the time-stranded Americans and find allies to survive the war raging around you, or play another country and see what advantage technology from the future can bring you in this turbulent time.
