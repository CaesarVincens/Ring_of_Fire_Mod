Laud and Wentworth had both fallen from favor with King Charles over the last couple months and become familiar and favorable to our embassy. Cromwell and a few others have travelled north to Scotland to see if they can rally an opposition to Charles and his supporters."
 RoF_USE.213.db:0 "In a series of events that will surely be dramatized one day in a blockbuster film, our embassy was rescued from the Tower of Londen by a team of semi-official special agents, known as the Wrecking Crew. The rescue included not only our embassy, but also the family of a Tower guard, Archbishop William Laud, and Thomas Wentworth and his family. Laud and Wentworth had both fallen from favor with King Charles over the last couple months and become familiar and favorable to our embassy. A few of the embassy have travelled north to Scotland to meet Cromwell and see if they can rally an opposition to Charles and his supporters."
 RoF_USE.213.a:0 "Perhaps Wentworth will be part of the oppisition now as well."
 RoF_USE.214.t:0 "Embassy in Scotland"
 RoF_USE.214.da:0 "The party who remained in England have made their way to Scotland. Many of the mercenaries in King Gustavus' army come from Scotland as do many of the Americans' ancestors, though a different history. Moreover, while Scottish politics have tangles all their own, many or most are not very fond of King Charles, for all that his father was the king of Scotland before becoming the king of England. Cromwell hopes to find allies here to stand against Charles when the time comes."

 RoF_USE.220.t:0 "Embassy to Venice"
 RoF_USE.220.d:0 "Venice is the premier trading port of the Mediterranean, at least of those held by Christians. Many of the goods and materials we want will be shipped through here. It is imperative that we maintain good relations with the Doge and Council of Venice.\nWe have sent our Catholic priest and our resident expert in medicines as well, as we hope to make good contact with the Papal State and the universities in Italy."
 RoF_USE.220.a:0 "May this be a profitable exchange."
 RoF_USE.221.t:0 "Embassy in Venice"
 RoF_USE.221.d:0 "The embassy to Venice has gone well so far. We have made good deals to exchange our knowledge in return for trade agreements.\n\nHowever, there has been a slight snag as the three sons of our medicine expert have become involved with the local Committee of Correspondence, really just a single family. They have discovered that  Galilei is currently on trial in the Vatican for his views on Heliocentrism. Determined to rescue Galileo, they have set off to Rome. Fortunately, our priest and his escort were called to Rome for the trial as well, so they may be able to prevent any rash action."
 RoF_USE.221.a:0 "This could get complicated."
 RoF_USE.222.t:0 "The Galileo Affair"
 RoF_USE.222.d:0 "The boys and the Venice CoC made it to Rome, with much of the rest of the Embassy following after. They plan to rescue Galileo from his trial while the embassy is trying to prevent them from doing anything rash."
 RoF_USE.222.a:0 "This seems like trouble."
 RoF_USE.223.t:0 "Miracles in Rome"
 RoF_USE.223.d:0 "Miraculous events in Rome! The boys and their companions made it to the trial of Galileo. While they were prepared to resuce the man, it happened that some of their number were actually there to assassinate Pope Urban! Fortunately, the attempt was foiled and most of the assassins captured or killed. Sadly the mastermind, a French Huguenot, made his escape.\n\nAs it happens, Pope Urban had decided to acquit Galileo as he realized that Galileo's position was supported by further research from the up-time. Finally, our self-proclaimed 'country priest' has been elevated to the position of Cardinal-Protector of the United States of Europe."
 RoF_USE.223.a:0 "What wonders!"
