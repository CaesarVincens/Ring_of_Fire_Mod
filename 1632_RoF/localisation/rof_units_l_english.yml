 airship:0 "Airship"

Their gasbag, filled with hot air, hydrogen, or helium, provides the lifting power, so even heavy, down-time-made engines can be used to propel them through the sky. Airships can be used for transport, but with some modifications, aerial combat and other applications may be possible."
