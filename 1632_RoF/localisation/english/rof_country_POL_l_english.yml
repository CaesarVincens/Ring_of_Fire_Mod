 RoF_POL.40.t:0 "Delegate Signals Support"
 RoF_POL.40.desc:0 "A delegate has recently pledged to support [POL.GetLeader]'s proposal in the next vote of the Sejm. While the issue itself is fairly minor, the public vote of support from a previously outspoken critic of [POL.GetLeader] has raised many eyebrows around Warsaw.\n\nSome believe that this example will lead additional delegates to reconsider their stance."
 RoF_POL.40.a:0 "A useful ally."
 RoF_POL.42.t:0 "Delegate speaks out against Royal Policy"
 RoF_POL.42.desc:0 "A delegate has given a speech on the Sejm floor, saying that he can no longer support the "foolish and dangerous" policies of King [POL.GetLeader]. He further claimed that he knew several other delegate who thought similarly and would abandon the king in short order."
 RoF_POL.42.a:0 "He'll come running back soon enough."
 RoF_POL.44.t:0 "Opposition suffers defeat in the Sejm"
 RoF_POL.44.desc:0 "A motion to censure King [POL.GetLeader] has been defeated in the Sejm. While even its most ardent supporters had little hope that it would pass, the amount of votes against it came as a shock even to the most pessimistic of observers. It appears that the king enjoys a far greater level of support in the Sejm than most believed, which should help in advancing his agenda."
 RoF_POL.44.a:0 "Great."
 RoF_POL.46.t:0 "Magnate retires"
 RoF_POL.46.desc:0 "Following a minor heart attack, a senior magnate announced today that he will be retiring for health reasons. With more than two decades in the Sejm, the magnate built a large network of supporters and his influence carried a lot of weight. While technically only one man with one vote, many nobles nonetheless counted him as worth several votes as he was the key to secure several others. \n\nWithout the support of this key ally, King [POL.GetLeader] will find it a lot harder to secure the necessary votes to pass proposals."
 RoF_POL.46.a:0 "He will be missed. And his vote as well."
 RoF_POL.61.t:0 "Delegates from [POL_sejm_investment_state.GetName] offer Support"
 RoF_POL.61.desc:0 "The senior delegate from [POL_sejm_investment_state.GetName] has approached the government with an offer of support. His voivodeship suffers from critical under-investment, and a government-initiated economic stimulus program would certainly make him reconsider his stance on certain proposed government policies. The delegate is quite famous for being able to cut deals, making his vote worth several more."
 RoF_POL.61.a:0 "It is a very underdeveloped region."
 RoF_POL.61.b:0 "This smells of corruption."
 RoF_POL.62.desc:0 "The delegates from [POL_sejm_investment_state.GetName] have approached the government, offering their support for the King in return for an informal guarantee that [POL_sejm_investment_state.GetName] would be the site of a new arms depot for the army. They argue that building a depot in the area would create a lot of jobs and provide the army with much needed support in an increasingly dangerous world."
 RoF_POL.62.a:0 "They make a lot of good points."
 RoF_POL.62.b:0 "These kinds of deals are below the King."
 RoF_POL.63.t:0 "Delegates from [POL_sejm_investment_state.GetName] offer Support"
 RoF_POL.63.desc:0 "The delegation from [POL_sejm_investment_state.GetName] have approached the government with several suggestions to improve the infrastructure of the voivodeship. Royal funding should be made available to upgrade roads and bridges in order to promote commerce between the provinces. They also noted that support from the government in this would certainly make them more inclined to support the King more directly in his agenda."
 RoF_POL.63.a:0 "A commendable initiative."
 RoF_POL.63.b:0 "Let them try to push that through by themselves."
 RoF_POL.65.t:0 "Funding the University of Kraków"
 RoF_POL.65.da:0 "We secured support from the Sejm to fund the University of Kraków. However, we could still provide the funding from our own treasury to build goodwill from the faculty and provide a measure of control over the curiculum."

 RoF_POL.65.b:0 "Royal funding will ensure more support for us."
 RoF_POL.66.t:0 "Founding New Universities"
 RoF_POL.66.da:0 "We convinced the Sejm to provide funding for new Polish Universities, continuing our tradition of excellence. Still, if we want these to truly be royal universities, they should be funded out of the royal purse."
 RoF_POL.66.db:0 "The Sejm didn't not agree to provide additional funds to establish new universities in Poland. Still, we can afford to found a few new campuses."
 RoF_POL.66.a:0 "Let the Sejm fund it, college is expensive"
 RoF_POL.66.b:0 "Royal funding will ensure more support for us."
 RoF_POL.100.t:0 "The Death of Sigismund III"
 RoF_POL.100.d:0 "King Sigismund III has died.\n\nKing of Poland and Grand Duke of Lithuania; for a time, he even held the throne of Sweden, though he was deposed unjustly by his uncle. King Sigismund also fought and won against Russia.\nWhile fighting against the Ottoman Empire, he was treacherously attacked by his cousin, Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden. Though that war was lost, Poland remains the most powerful Christian country in Eastern Europe.\n\nThe Primate of Poland will call for an election sejm to decide the next king of Poland"

 RoF_POL.150.t:0 "Rezhev Expedition"
 RoF_POL.150.d:0 "One of the Szlachta has gone haring off to Russia and taken the city of Rezhev. While we cannot officially condone such actions, we shall see how he does."

 RoF_POL.151.t:0 "Rezhev Expedition Succeeds"

 RoF_POL.151.a:0 "Amazing"
 RoF_POL.152.t:0 "Rezhev Expedition Fails"
 RoF_POL.152.d:0 "The expedition to Rezhev has failed. They were not able to secure Rezhev strongly enough to repulse the Russian counter-attack. Despite support from another Szlachta, the expedition was defeated and captured."
 RoF_POL.152.a:0 "Fortunately, they cannot blame the crown."
 RoF_POL.153.t:0 "Rezhev Expedition Holds"
 RoF_POL.153.d:0 "The expedition to Rezhev has succeeded. They have been able to hold Rezhev, repelling the Russian counter-attack. However, the Russians have fortified the futher approaches and pushing onward is unlikely."

 POL_expand_the_franchise:0 "Expand the Franchise"
 POL_expand_the_franchise_desc:0 "For centuries, the Szlachta have been the only enfranchised class in Poland and Lithuania. However, they make up only around 10% of our total population. If we are to live up to our name as the Commonwealth, we must expand the franchise to all our citizens."
