 RoF_AUS.126.a:0 "Damnation!"
 RoF_AUS.130.t:0 "Issuing New Currency"
 RoF_AUS.130.d:0 "The Americans in Grantville are issuing paper currency without any silver backing it up. While this seems madness, their \"dollars\" are highly valued by merchants throughout the Germanies.\n\nWe need more funding for our war, and this seems a good way to raise cash."
 RoF_AUS.130.a:0 "Print as much as we need"
 RoF_AUS.130.b:0 "Let's not outdo our silver reserves"
 RoF_AUS.131.t:0 "Reichsthalers Crash"

 RoF_AUS.150.t:0 "The Death of Fedinand II"
 RoF_AUS.150.d:0 "Ferdinand II, Archduke of Austria, King of Hungary, and Emperor of the Holy Roman Empire, has died. His son takes the throne as Ferdinand III.

 RoF_AUS.155.d:0 "Ferdinand III, newly emperor of Austria-Hungary, has approved a planned railway linking Vienna, Prague, and Opole, thereby linking the Danube, Elbe, and Oder rivers. This would greatly improve the flow of trade through both our countries, but could also provide a quick entry for foreign troops."

 RoF_AUS.160.t:0 "Peace with Bohemia"
 RoF_AUS.160.d:0 "It's becoming clearer every day that the Ottoman Empire will attack us sooner than later. It's also clear that we will not regain Bohemia from Wallenstein, treacherous dog that he is; he still has the [NUS.GetNameDef] backing him. We need to come to terms so we can focus our efforts against the Ottoman threat."

 RoF_AUS.163.a:0 "We must pray he changes his mind."
 RoF_AUS.170.t:0 "Seek Aid against the Ottomans"
 RoF_AUS.170.d:0 "Austria is not as powerful as it once was, and our usual allies against the Ottoman Empire, Poland, is occupied in their own war. Our hired Americans though, give us a new option, the USE. Perhaps they will see wisdom in stopping the Ottoman on our doorstep instead of theirs."
 RoF_AUS.170.a:0 "We shall see what Gustavus Adolphus will say."
 RoF_AUS.171.t:0 "Alliance against the Ottomans"
 RoF_AUS.171.d:0 "Austria has come to us asking for aid against the Ottoman Empire, which is preparing to attack any day. The advantage for us is keeping the fighting further from our lands and securing peace on our southern border."
 RoF_AUS.171.a:0 "Let us forge these new bonds of brotherhood."
 RoF_AUS.171.b:0 "Let the Austrians hang. If the Ottomans come for us, we will be ready."
