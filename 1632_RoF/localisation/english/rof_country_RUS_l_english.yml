 RoF_RUS.110.d:0 "We have just received word that a Polish army has captured Rezhev near the mouth of the Volga. We must make haste to recapture the city before the Poles can entrench themselves."

 RoF_RUS.119.t:0 "Defence of Kazan"
 RoF_RUS.119.d:0 "The Volga River is the only viable route for an army to go from west to east in Russia. Kazan sits close enough to the river to act as a stronghold and prevent passage of enemy forces. We must reinforce Kazan and make sure none of Sheremetev's forces reach Ufa."
 RoF_RUS.119.a:0 "For the Czar!"
 RoF_RUS.120.t:0 "The Russian Civil War"
 RoF_RUS.120.d:0 "Czar Mikhail has established himself in the eastern city of Ufa.

 RoF_RUS.130.t:0 "A Russian Constitution"
 RoF_RUS.130.d:0 "Our agent in Grantville has returned to us in Ufa with a proposed constitution for Russia. The initial proposal is not dissimilar to the up-time United States; however, if we wish to have the support of the many factions in Russia, there will likely be many changes.\n\nThe groups are roughly split into commoner states, the Cossacks and current and former serfs among them, and the noble states, including many levels of nobles who are undecided between Czar Mikhail and Director Sheremetev."
 RoF_RUS.130.a:0 "Let the debate begin"
 RoF_RUS.131.t:0 "The Question of Serfdom"
 RoF_RUS.131.d:0 "Many of the delegates to our convention are nobles or represent nobles.

 RoF_RUS.133.t:0 "The Head of State"

 RoF_RUS.133.b:0 "The House of Commons shall elect a lord"
 RoF_RUS.133.c:0 "The House of Commons shall elect a commoner"
 RoF_RUS.133.do:0 "Dual executives, one from each house, with the Czar as tie-breaker"
 RoF_RUS.134.t:0 "Religious Freedom"
 RoF_RUS.134.d:0 "The question of religion has been hanging over the convention for a few days now. Many delegates have come from Siberian tribes who practice their own pagan religions. Others practice Islam, such as Kazan, our shield against Sheremetev's army."
 RoF_RUS.134.a:0 "Russia is, and will always be, an orthodox nation"
 RoF_RUS.134.b:0 "Each state may choose a religion to favor"

 RoF_RUS.1351.t:0 "Failed Negotiations"
 RoF_RUS.1351.d:0 "Our initial attempt at negotions failed and the Kazakhs continue their siege of Ufa. It seems our only chance is to fight."
 RoF_RUS.1351.a:0 "Prepare a sortie"
 RoF_RUS.136.t:0 "Counter-Attack!"
 RoF_RUS.136.da:0 "Our forces marched out of the city and attacked the Kazakh army. Our new rifles provided a key edge during the battle. The Kazakhs suffered heavy casualties and were forced to break the siege and retreat."
 RoF_RUS.136.db:0 "Our forces marched out of the city and attacked the Kazakh army. Despite our new rifles, the open field favored the Kazakh army. We suffered heavy casualties and were barely able to save the bulk of our army."
 RoF_RUS.136.a:0 "Huzzah!"
 RoF_RUS.136.b:0 "Terrible!"
 RoF_RUS.137.t:0 "Another Russian Offer"
 RoF_RUS.137.d:0 "The Russians in Ufa have approached under a flag of truce. It happens that they are willing to trade us for their weapons, so an attack is not necessary to secure these weapons. They have also offered for us to sit in on their constitutional convention as observers."
 RoF_RUS.137.a:0 "Very well, let us talk"
 RoF_RUS.137.b:0 "Ha, then we will take their guns too"
 RoF_RUS.138.t:0 "Other Possibilities"
 RoF_RUS.138.d:0 "The recent battle has made it clear that taking Ufa will not be easy. [Root.USR_KAZ_battle_negotiations]"
 USR_KAZ_battle_negotiations_1:0 "What's more, one of the soldiers we captured has let it slip that they would sell us the guns we have been offered, if we had come in peace."

 RoF_RUS.138.a:0 "Perhaps peace can still be had"
 RoF_RUS.138.b:0 "It is too costly; let us leave"
 RoF_RUS.139.t:0 "The Kazakhs Join the Convention"
 RoF_RUS.139.d:0 "After negotiating a cease-fire, the Kazakh Khan, [KAZ.GetLeader] has decided to join our constitutional convention as an observer, though he seems interesting in allying himself with us."
 RoF_RUS.139.a:0 "Quite a change of pace"
 RoF_RUS.140.t:0 "The Kazakhs Leave"
 RoF_RUS.140.d:0 "After the battle with the Kazakhs, they have decided it is too costly to take Ufa and have returned to their own territory."
 RoF_RUS.140.a:0 "Finally, we can get back to the convention"
 RoF_RUS.141.t:0 "Voting Rights"
 RoF_RUS.141.d:0 "One of the last issues at the convention is voting rights. The commoner states are concerned about the representation of serfs and slaves in noble states.\nThis issue may be what makes or breaks our new country in the end."
 RoF_RUS.141.a:0 "Only nobles can be trusted with the vote"
