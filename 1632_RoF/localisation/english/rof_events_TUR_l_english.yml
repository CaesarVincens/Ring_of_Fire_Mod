 RoF_TUR.100.t:0 "The Regency of Murad IV"
 RoF_TUR.100.d:0 "Sultan Murad has been the official ruler of the Ottoman Empire for nearly 8 years; however, the true power has resided in his mother, Kösem Sultan, and his various viziers. The previous two sultans, Murad's uncle and brother, were both deposed by palace intrigues. Murad must take control of the government if he is going to last longer than they did."
 RoF_TUR.100.a:0 "For the Sultan!"
 RoF_TUR.101.t:0 "Dealing with Hüsrev Pasha"
 RoF_TUR.101.d:0 "Hüsrev Pasha has been the Grand Vizier for three years now, since the previous Grand Vizier failed to put down a rebellion. Hüsrev has been very effective as the Grand Vizier, effectively running the state for the underage Murad. However, his will is not the will of Murad; and his recent failure to retake Baghdad provides Murad an opportunity to replace him. Alternately, we might keep him as the Grand Vizier, but make it clear his responsibilities are being curtailed."
 RoF_TUR.101.a:0 "Hüsrev must go"
 TUR_husrev_dismissed:0 "Hüsrev Pasha has been dismissed"
 RoF_TUR.101.b:0 "Hüsrev will have a second chance"
 TUR_husrev_pasha.TT:0 "§RHüsrev Pasha may decide later that he wants his power back§!"
 TUR_husrev_curtailed:0 "Hüsrev Pasha's authority has been curtailed"
 RoF_TUR.1011.t:0 "Janissary Revolt"
 RoF_TUR.1011.d:0 "Hüsrev Pasha was quite popular as the Grand Vizier, and since we dismissed him from the post, there have been grumblings from his supporters. This unrest has erupted now and rebels among the Janissaries and Bureaucrats have killed our current Grand Vizier, Hafız Ahmed Pasha."
 RoF_TUR.1011.a:0 "Punish these rebels harshly and execute Hüsrev"
 TUR_hafiz_killed:0 "Hafız Ahmed Pasha has been killed"
 TUR_husrev_killed:0 "Hüsrev Pasha has been executed"
 RoF_TUR.1011.b:0 "Light punishments will restore order better"
 RoF_TUR.1012.t:0 "Topal Recep Pasha's Betrayal"
 RoF_TUR.1012.d:0 "Our Grand Visier and brother-in-law, Topal Recep Pasha, was part of the plot that resulted in the murder of Hafız Ahmed Pasha. He encouraged the rebels and orchestrated much of the attempted coup."
 RoF_TUR.1012.a:0 "He must be excuted for this crime!"
 TUR_recep_discovered:0 "Topal Recep Pasha's crime has been discovered"
 TUR_recep_killed:0 "Topal Recep Pasha has been executed"
 RoF_TUR.1012.b:0 "He will be exiled, but we should not kill our brother-in-law."
 RoF_TUR.1013.t:0 "Hüsrev Pasha Attempts a Coup"
 RoF_TUR.1013.d:0 "Hüsrev Pasha has grown bold again after we forgave his earlier incompentence. He has attempted to overthrow the Sultan in a palace coup. Fortunately the plot was discovered and he has been arrested."
 RoF_TUR.1013.a:0 "He must be excuted for this crime!"
 RoF_TUR.1013.b:0 "Banishment will suffice. Killing him may make him a martyr."
 RoF_TUR.102.t:0 "Ottoman Bureaucracy"
 RoF_TUR.102.d:0 "The Ottoman Empire is a bureaucratic empire, with many scribes and functionaries who keep the machinery of the state running. While they are all servants of the Sultan, there are still factions and politics to negotiate in order for the bureaucracy to operate a peak efficency. Sultan Murad can  deal with the current bureaucrats, or replace any whose loyalty is questionable."
 RoF_TUR.102.a:0 "We need experienced scribes,\neven if we can't fully trust them."
 RoF_TUR.102.b:0 "We need loyal scribes,\neven if they are less effective."
 TUR_new_bureaucrats.TT:0 "The new scribes will eventually become more effective"
 RoF_TUR.103.t:0 "A New Bureaucracy"
 RoF_TUR.103.d:0 "Our new corps of scribes and bureaucrats are now trained well-enough to effectively run our empire again."
 RoF_TUR.103.a:0 "Excellent"
 RoF_TUR.104.t:0 "Ottoman Beylerbeys"
 RoF_TUR.104.d:0 "The Beylerbeys who govern the many provinces of the Empire are a diverse group. While they mostly support the Sultan, occasionally they must be reminded not to overstep their authority. As Murad is just coming into his own, a show of generosity, or we can begin replacing any disloyal governors."
 RoF_TUR.104.a:0 "Generosity will win them over"
 RoF_TUR.104.b:0 "Their loyalty must be absolute"
 RoF_TUR.1041.t:0 "Disloyal Beylerbeys Weakened"
 RoF_TUR.1041.d:0 "The Beylerbeys who showed us disloyalty have been replaced or moved to new beyliks where they have no local support. We should continue strengthing our position over the governors or find ways to reform our system."
 RoF_TUR.1041.a:0 "This will do for now"
 RoF_TUR.105.t:0 "The Valide Sultan"
 RoF_TUR.105.d:0 "Sultan Murad IV now has the support of most of the Ottoman government and military. It is time for Murad's mother, Kösem Sultan, to step aside from her role as regent and support her son's agenda. Alternatively, we may force her to retire entirely from court life."
 RoF_TUR.105.a:0 "She will advise us."
 RoF_TUR.105.b:0 "She must retire from public life."
 RoF_TUR.110.t:0 "American Overtures"
 RoF_TUR.110.d:0 "We have received a missive from an oddly named princedom in Germany. This /"New United States/" claims to be from the future. They wish to establish friendly relations with the Empire for mutual benefit. If what they are claiming is true, it could shake the Empire to its very core. The possible advantages are many, but so are the risks."
 RoF_TUR.110.a:0 "We will ignore these charletans, and decree it a falsehood."
 RoF_TUR.110.b:0 "This is the opporunity of the century!"
 RoF_TUR.1101.t:0 "Rumors from Germany"
 RoF_TUR.1101.d:0 "There are rumors of a new, oddly-named princedom in Germany. This /"New United States/" is said to be from the future. If this is true, it could shake the Empire to its very core. The possible advantages are many, but so are the risks."
 RoF_TUR.1101.a:0 "We will decree these stories to be falsehoods."
 RoF_TUR.1101.b:0 "This is the opporunity of the century!"
 RoF_TUR.150.t:0 "Military Reforms"
 RoF_TUR.150.d:0 "It has become clear that the Ottoman military is not as powerful as it once was as evidenced by the losses against Persia in the east in the previous decade. A main cause for this decline is the decadence and corruption of the Janissary and the Sipahi Corps. Any moves to reform our military will have to be taken carefully to avoid goading the soldiers into full rebellion."
 RoF_TUR.150.a:0 "Slow, moderate reforms will be enough for now."
 RoF_TUR.150.b:0 "We must overhaul our army if we wish to keep up with our neighbors."
 RoF_TUR.150.c:0 "Do we really need reforms?"
 RoF_TUR.151.t:0 "Weakening the Janissaries"
 RoF_TUR.151.d:0 "Test"
 RoF_TUR.160.t:0 "Revan Feint"
 RoF_TUR.160.d:0 "As Sultan Murad decreed, the war with Persia has begun a new phase. While the main body of the army marches towards Baghdad, a large division has been sent to Revan, which the Persians call Erivan. This city does provide a strategic control over the northern reaches of the Persian realm, and it was under Ottoman control from 1590 until the current war started in 1603. However, the main purpose of this siege is to draw the Persian forces away from Baghdad, to make it easier for the Sultan to capture the Jewel of Iraq."
 RoF_TUR.160.a:0 "The Persians have no idea what's coming"
 RoF_TUR.164.t:0 "Capture of Baghdad"
 RoF_TUR.164.d:0 "We have retaken Baghdad and decisively defeated the Persians. We could continue, but our true prize lies to the West and Persia can wait for another time."
 RoF_TUR.164.a:0 "Let us extend an honorable peace to the Persians."
 RoF_TUR.164.b:0 "Let us press the attack while they are reeling."
 RoF_TUR.164.a.TT:0 "If Persia agrees:"
 RoF_TUR.165.t:0 "Treaty of Zuhar"
 RoF_TUR.165.d:0 "The Ottomans have retaken Baghdad and are now offering us peace by returning to the status quo of the Peace of Amasya, plus a bit extra in their favor."
 RoF_TUR.165.a:0 "These new weapons they bring to bear are devasating our armies. We must agree."
 RoF_TUR.165.b:0 "The Persian spirit will never be conquered!"
 RoF_TUR.166.t:0 "Treaty of Qasr-e Shirin"
 RoF_TUR.166.d:0 "The Persians have agreed to our peace offer and ceded us Iraq and Armenia"
 RoF_TUR.166.a:0 "Huzzah"
 RoF_TUR.167.t:0 "Persians Reject Peace"
 RoF_TUR.167.d:0 "The Persians have rejected to our peace offer and continue to fight."
 RoF_TUR.167.a:0 "This will end poorly for them."
 RoF_TUR.170.t:0 "War with Austria"
 RoF_TUR.170.d:0 "Now that Iraq is back in our hands, we have turned our attention West. Austria stands as the bulwark against us for the rest of Europe; if we can defeat them, Europe will be ours shortly."
 RoF_TUR.170.a:0 "To Vienna!"
 RoF_TUR.171.t:0 "Siege of Vienna"
 RoF_TUR.171.d:0 "Our new weapons, the rockets, tanks, and airships proved decisive in quickly breaking through the Austrian defenses in Vienna. We have captured the city, though the \"Emperor\" and his family had already fled up the Danube."
 RoF_TUR.171.a:0 "Huzzah for the Sultan!"
 RoF_TUR.200.t:0 "The Ottomans Want Rifles"
 RoF_TUR.200.d:0 "The Ottoman Empire has sent agents to us to purchase some of our new rifles for their army. They are prepared to pay premium prices and offer guarantees that they will not use them against us."
 RoF_TUR.200.a:0 "What an opportunity!"
 RoF_TUR.200.b:0 "We can't trust the Turks!"
 RoF_TUR.201.t:0 "[From.GetNameDef] will sell us Rifles"
 RoF_TUR.201.d:0 "[From.GetNameDef] has agreed to sell us their new rifles"
 RoF_TUR.201.a:0 "Excellent!"
 RoF_TUR.202.t:0 "[From.GetNameDef] will not sell us Rifles"
 RoF_TUR.202.d:0 "[From.GetNameDef] has not agreed to sell us their new rifles"
 RoF_TUR.202.a:0 "Disappointing!"
