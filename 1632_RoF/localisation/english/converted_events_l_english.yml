 conv.political.07.b:10 "A movement for the people must seek support from the people."
 conv.political.07.d:10 "'[Root.GetLeader] wields absolute power in [Root.GetName]. His whims dictate law and no one is safe from his displeasure. We need a constitution to limit his power and guarantee stability!'\n\nSo speak new voices in the [Root.GetAdjective] constitutionalist movement. Referring to the rule of [Root.GetRulingParty] as a dictatorship, they have begun calling for it to be brought out of power by any means necessary. Whether those means will come from within or without remains to be seen."
 conv.political.07.t:10 "Constitutionalism on the Rise"
 conv.political.08.a.tt:10 "If public support is sufficient, a coup can be executed."
 conv.political.08.a:10 "We'll keep a close eye on them too, for many reasons."
 conv.political.08.d:10 "Although the party line of the [Root.GetRulingParty] is to strongly oppose constitutionalism, some people in government are more open to the possibility. If nothing else, they see room for addressing the concerns of the people who look to constitutionalists for solutions without risking a full-scale civil war.\n\nAlthough they may be seen as traitors by those who remain loyal to [Root.GetLeader], these dissident voices may be the ones to ensure a relatively bloodless transition should the revolution come."
 conv.political.08.t:10 "Constitutionalist Sympathies in Government"
 conv.political.09.a:10 "The tides of history will sweep away the past."
 conv.political.09.d:10 "While the popular movement for constitutionalism has been loud and terrifying, a certain section of the political movement has been largely quiet and waiting. The wait is now over. Today, just as the [Root.GetRulingParty] leadership and army were bracing for a revolt on national scale, a number of officials in the [Root.GetAdjective] government swiftly placed [Root.GetLeader] under house arrest and entered negotiations with the rebels.\n\nWhile retaining a pretense of safeguarding order, what the negotiations effectively amounted to was to secure positions within the new constitutional state for those who chose to cooperate. The coup was finished before anyone could move to stop it, and those who would have are now imprisoned, exiled or executed by the new regime."
 conv.political.09.t:10 "Constitutionalists Execute Coup"
 conv.political.10.a:10 "The people may call themselves whatever they want."
 conv.political.10.d:10 "The constitutionalist movement, once a fringe popular among certain nobles and merchants, has seen increased support among the [Root.GetAdjective] commoners. The fact that peasants care about the halls of power implies that constitutionalist ideas are spreading beyond those who actively seek to overthrow the government."
 conv.political.10.t:10 "Calls for a Constitution in [Root.GetName]"
 conv.political.11.a:10 "Perhaps they are merely fighting for a different [Root.GetName]."
 conv.political.11.d:10 "'Lords and kings would have you spill your blood for them on the front lines, over disputes that do not concern the common man! Instead of taking up arms against others who struggle abroad, raise them against the oppressors and overthrow the tyrants!'\n\nThe army, usually a bastion of patriotism and loyalty, has proven not to be immune to the constitutionalist propaganda spreading rapidly in [Root.GetName]. Soldiers are deserting, refusing to fight for their country, sometimes going as far as joining partisan movements that claim to be preparing for revolution."

 conv.political.22.d:10 "[Root.GetName] has always been filled up by monarchist ideas. However, new groups of more radical thinkers are supporting the idea of totally removing the State from the life of our people and this idea is slowly getting support among the commoners of [Root.GetName]. What should the government do about this, however, is difficult to tell."
 conv.political.22.t:10 "The Threat of Radicalism in [Root.GetName]"
 conv.political.23.a:10 "A stateless rabble will never manage to conquer [Root.GetName]"

 conv.political.25.a:10 "We can discuss this internally for a start."
 conv.political.25.b.tt:10 "Increases the chance of people voicing support for democracy and forming an opposition."
 conv.political.25.b:10 "Knowing we're in the right, we can afford allowing our enemies to talk more openly."
 conv.political.25.d:10 "'If we silence the voices of the people, how can any of us claim to be the voice of [Root.GetName] ourselves? If we fear dissent, if we fear being publicly denounced or ousted by public vote, what we truly fear is that we are hated and reviled by our own citizens. Does the [Root.GetRulingParty] really have so little confidence in its principles?'\n\nA careful and loosely organized, but passionate faction in the government has begun to push for less repressive policies against enemies of the state. They want the public involved in decision-making through referendums and local party meetings, even if this means risking the future of the current agenda."
 conv.political.25.t:10 "Move Towards Democracy"
 conv.political.26.a.tt:10 "The government may arrange elections when the policy has majority support."
 conv.political.26.a:10 "The choice may not always stand between liberty and death."
 conv.political.26.d:10 "Surprisingly, the call for more referendums and less repressive measures against opponents of the regime has received some support in internal party discussions. While [Root.GetRulingParty] leadership remains skeptical, several influential members have supported a shift.\n\nPerhaps they have confidence that little will change in practice, or perhaps they are secretly traitors to the party cause, as many of their opponents would have it. Regardless, if the public call for such changes should come, some of the leaders of [Root.GetName] are ready to compromise."
 conv.political.26.t:10 "[Root.GetRulingParty] Debates Democracy"
 conv.political.27.a:10 "The movement appears to grow naturally in the absence of of repression."
 conv.political.27.d:10 "Relaxing the restrictions on what sort of anti-[Root.GetRulingParty] propaganda can be spread publicly has, predictably, lead to an increase in public expressions of dissent. Organized demonstrations and pamphlets are so far found mostly in academic institutions and some of [Root.GetName]'s more unfortunate areas, but there is little doubt that the movement is spreading.\n\nThe nation's leaders are torn over the issue. [Root.GetLeader], who maintains an iron grip on party leadership, has little desire to diversify public debate. The first steps have already been taken, however, and there may be no turning back."
 conv.political.27.t:10 "Democratic Opposition Forming"
 conv.political.28.a:10 "Even if reform is happening, we must show our strength by suppressing this defiance."
 conv.political.28.b:10 "Let the people be heard."
 conv.political.28.d:10 "The demonstrations of public dissent which were once confined to limited areas are now widespread. While people gather in the streets, the [Root.GetRulingParty] finds itself at a crossroads. If we continue allowing this propaganda to spread, the referendums suggested both from within the party itself as well as the opposition may show that we do not have the support of the public. The unity we have strived for is giving way to a plurality of opinions, united against us."
 conv.political.28.t:10 "Public Call for Elections"
 conv.political.29.a:10 "Those loyal to the [Root.GetRulingParty] will support the decision now."
 conv.political.29.b:10 "The reforms need broader support before an election can be held."
 conv.political.29.d:10 "As freedom of expression and assembly have grown to become increasingly accepted in [Root.GetName], the faction within the [Root.GetRulingParty] calling for holding elections has gone from secret conspirators to publicly supported reformers. Despite [Root.GetLeader]'s protests, the country has been making a slow but steady move towards democracy for the past months and an election now seems like the natural next step.\n\nHowever, far from all [Root.GetAdjective] citizens are in favor of democratic reforms. There is still debate within the party regarding whether to wait holding the election until we can ensure a stable development."
 conv.political.29.t:10 "Public Election in [Root.GetName]"
 conv.political.30.a:10 "God may be the Creator, but surely not the correct one to choose the leader of [Root.GetName]."
 conv.political.30.b:10 "Clergy always tried to stand against our regime. What is the difference now?"
 conv.political.30.c:10 "At the end, a state must respect the will of its people. [Root.GetName] will hold the referendum"
 conv.political.30.d:10 "[Root.GetLeader] is only seen as a usurper by these evergrowing movements in [Root.GetName]. Soon, [Root.GetAdjective] people will revolt against the government, asking for a strong leader chosen by God Almighty. They are now demanding by us to make all humans who believe in the only God to choose whether they want the monarchy or the current regime."
 conv.political.30.t:10 "[Root.GetAdjective] Reactionaries demanding referendum"
 conv.political.31.a:10 "We will not bow to their wishes!"
 conv.political.31.b:10 "Ignore them, they're just causing trouble."
 conv.political.31.c:10 "The referendum is preferable to a bloody revolt."
 conv.political.31.d:10 "Constitutionalist ideas took root in [Root.GetName] a long time ago, but have gained much more widespread support lately. The movement has spread outside political theory and into political practice, with disgruntled nobles and even some high-profile merchants voicing support. The Constitutionalists call this rule of law. The [Root.GetRulingParty] call it a fast track to riots and treason.\n\nShowing little faith in [Root.GetLeader] being willing to implement the reforms they demand, the more vocal constitutionalists have called for an immediate referendum to have the current government removed. While we might be able to reverse the momentum of this mass movement, failure to do so will doubtlessly result in the more popular constitutionalist method of removal: Revolution."
 conv.political.31.t:10 "Constitutionalists Demand Referendum"
 conv.political.32.a:10 "Round them up."
 conv.political.32.b:10 "Just proceed as usual."
 conv.political.32.c:10 "If we accept the referendum, perhaps we can preserve our legacy."
 conv.political.32.d:10 "Unsurprisingly, the idea of the people ruling the nation they inhabit can easily grow very popular among the people. The [Root.GetRulingParty], of course, sees the idea of democracy as represented by these movements - freedom of speech, public elections, free press - merely populist rhetoric meant to weaken [Root.GetLeader]'s government.\n\nHowever, there is no denying those ideas have taken hold among the [Root.GetAdjective] population. In true democratic fashion, they call for a public referendum on replacing the current regime. Although currently easy to ignore, these ideas have a way of growing very persistent. What will happen to us if we make peaceful revolution impossible?"
 conv.political.32.t:10 "Democrats Demand Referendum"
 conv.political.34.a:10 "The State won't renounce to its existance because of these radicals!"
 conv.political.34.b:10 "If our subjects won't support us, we will remind why we rule."
 conv.political.34.c:10 "The will of the people is to hold a referendum? Good, let's show them that the masses won't be able to rule themselves."
 conv.political.34.d:10 "The day has come, [Root.GetLeader]. The radicals now spread their ideas throughout [Root.GetName] and the people now demand a referendum. They want the current regime, deemed by them as immoral and corrupt, to be removed."
 conv.political.34.t:10 "[Root.GetAdjective] Radicals demanding referendum"
 conv.political.35.a:10 "Time to show these mediæval protesters how modern war is done."
 conv.political.35.b:10 "In the name of God Almighty, may He choose who to lead [Root.GetName]!"
 conv.political.35.d:10 "Oh, [Root.GetLeader], the people thought you were not chosen by God and they tried to persuade you to do a referendum. But having you denied them, they preferred to do the will of God Almighty by themselves."
 conv.political.35.t:10 "For God to lead [Root.GetName]!"
 conv.political.36.a:10 "We won't allow them to ruin our country!"
 conv.political.36.b:10 "Sic semper tyrannus!"
 conv.political.36.d:10 "After their request for a referendum was denied, the few reformers of the constitutionalist movement in [Root.GetName] rapidly lost influence to the more radical elements. With the [Root.GetRulingParty]'s refusal to acknowledge the public support for the suggested reforms, the romantic view of the revolution gradually grew more widespread and the leaders of the movement become those who could most easily start a riot. Those riots have now erupted into a full-scale civil war, with the future of the nation at stake."
 conv.political.36.t:10 "Constitutionalists Rise Up"
 conv.political.37.a:10 "Spare us from this mob rule!"
 conv.political.37.b:10 "At long last, [Root.GetName] is free!"
 conv.political.37.d:10 "After their attempt at a public referendum to institute democracy was refused, the people behind the suggestion have dismissed the [Root.GetLeader] regime as incorrigible. A broad coalition of rebel groups, united by their common goal of instituting more representative political systems in [Root.GetName], have taken up arms and announced that they will not rest until the [Root.GetRulingParty] is overthrown."
 conv.political.37.t:10 "The [Root.GetAdjective] Spring"
 conv.political.39.a:10 "They'll regret the day they forgot the State still exists even without them."
 conv.political.39.b:10 "We have a small loan of one million dollars thanks to our left-leaning policies. Better to have the economy led by these experts."
 conv.political.39.d:10 "The plague of Radicalism has spread everywhere in [Root.GetName] and so, after having tried a diplomatic solution and having failed, they are now revolting against the current regime and have taken up arms to destroy us."
 conv.political.39.t:10 "Radicals revolt!"
 conv.political.40.a:10 "Pathetic, that's the right word."
 conv.political.40.d:10 "The self-styled King of [Root.GetName] is now dead and his followers forgot how to fight. The people learnt the lesson, our regime is protected by God more than those pathetic old men yelling at clouds."
 conv.political.40.t:10 "Fanatic Reactionaries defeated"
 conv.political.41.a:10 "What a bunch of hypocrites."
 conv.political.41.d:10 "Many constitutionalists had predicted that [Root.GetLeader] was going to be reined in quickly, but after a few months of protests and calls for reform in the streets, the movement seems to have died down. The commoners, the supposed driving force of the reforms, have more pressing concerns than overthrowing [Root.GetLeader] and seem decidedly unimpressed with how well these reforms have played out elsewhere. Meanwhile, the nobles who wrote passionate calls for a new constitution have turned out to be surprisingly reluctant to instigate anything that might actually upset their comfortable lifestyle.\n\nTalk of reforms will likely continue, whether over cheap beers or expensive wines, but it will likely be talk and nothing more."
 conv.political.41.t:10 "Constitutionalist Fad Blows Over"
 conv.political.42.a:10 "What a bunch of quitters."
 conv.political.42.d:10 "After a few months of loud opposition against [Root.GetLeader]'s regime, calling for public elections and more liberal laws on freedom of assembly and speech, the movement seems to have fallen apart. People now express more concern about the stability of [Root.GetName] if such reforms were to take place, with those who clamor for democracy being seen more as troublemakers than everything else.\n\nMore mysteriously, many of the leading figures of the movement appear to have gone missing or stopped their work suddenly. Perhaps some of them chose to go into exile when they saw the failure of their efforts. Regardless, the [Root.GetRulingParty] government denies all knowledge and involvement."
 conv.political.42.t:10 "Democratic Movement Goes Silent"
 conv.political.44.a:10 "So much for self-determination."
 conv.political.44.d:10 "After having conquered their main center, the rebellious Radicals had no more enough support to keep their rabbles march. Their defeat is now seen by our loyal people as the sign of their ineptitude and that the State is needed as much as air is."
 conv.political.44.t:10 "Radicals rebuked"
