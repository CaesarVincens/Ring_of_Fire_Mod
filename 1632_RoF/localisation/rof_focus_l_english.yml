 ENG_an_island_nation_desc:0 "England has always been an island nation, threatened only by the Scots from the North and the possibility of naval invasion from the continent.\n\nOur military history has left us with the experiences on how best to exploit the geography of the land with the forces available to us. "
 ENG_navy_reforms:0 "Navy Reforms"
 ENG_navy_reforms_desc:0 "The Navy's record under Charles I has not been glorious. There have been many expensive failures, including against the Algerian pirates in 1620, the Spanish in 1625, and the French at La Rochelle in 1627/28.\n\nAs more and more surprising information comes out of the so-called Ring of Fire, our captains understand that the tides of change are upon us."

 ENG_artillery_regiments_desc:0 "Until now, the artillery of England has been assembled for war as needed, from stockpiles of weapons and the gunners from castles and strongpoints around England. This has sufficed until now, but with the development of ever more powerful and accurate weapons elsewhere, it cannot continue.\n\nDeveloping our own accurate, standardised artillery trains manned by dedicated professionals will greatly multiple the ferocity of our army."

We require Marines."
 ENG_new_cavalry:0 "The New Cavalry"
