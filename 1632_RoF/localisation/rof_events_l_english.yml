 RoF_USE.115.d:0 "Although we were confident in the ability of our ironclads, we never truly expected such a devestating effect as we saw when our fleet finally met the Ostender Fleet. Despite being outnumbered, our far superior guns and armor made the battle a lopsided affair. The enemy's shot bounced from our hull, while our explosive shells made kindling of theirs. After the first few ships were destroyed, most of the remaining Ostenders surrended rather than submit to the same fate."
