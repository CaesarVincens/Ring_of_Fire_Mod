 up_time_weapons_short:0 "Up-Time Weapons"
 up_time_weapons_desc:0 "Weapons from up-time, these have massive advantages in rate-of-fire, accuracy, and reliability over weapons produced here and now. However, we lack the tools to make them in any useful number."
 early_flintlock:0 "Early Flintlocks"
 early_flintlock_short:0 "Early Flintlocks"

 srg_flintlock_short:0 "SRG Rifle"
 srg_flintlock_desc:0 "The SRG is based on the up-time Pattern 1853 Enfield rifle, but adapted to use a flintlock mechanism. The Struve-Reardon Gevar (SRG) is poised to make a revolution on the battlefields of Europe. It uses a Minie ball with rifling giving far greater accuracy and range than any contemporary weapon."
 srg_caplock:	"Struve-Reardon Gevar MkII"
 srg_caplock_short:0 "SRG Rifle MkII"
 srg_caplock_desc:0 "The SRG MkII is an improvement over the original SRG by converting the flinklock to a caplock. Using prepared cartridges increases reloading time immensely."
 cardinal_rifle:0 "Cardinal Rifle"
 cardinal_rifle_short:0 "Cardinal"
 cardinal_rifle_desc:0 "Developed in France, the Cardinal Rifle is the first breech-loading caplock designed down-time. It uses potassium chlorate for its percussion caps rather than the more volatile murcury fulminate. Using prepared cartridges, it has a higher-rate of fire than any muzzle-loading weapon."
 ak3_rifle:0 "AK3 Rifle"
 ak3_rifle_short:0 "AK3"
 ak3_rifle_desc:0 "Developed in Russia, the AK3 rifle uses replaceable firing chambers with a flintlock mechanism. As long as prepared chambers are available, it has a much higher rate-of-fire than muzzle-loading muskets."

 single_plane_equipment:0 "Light Airplane"
 single_plane_equipment_desc:0 "Light Airplanes in the 17th century are modeled after early up-time planes. They are fairly small with minimal payload capacity. Their primary use is for reconnaissance, though they have some ground attack capability. They can also function as transport for important individuals."

 airship_equipment:0 "Airship"
 airship_equipment_desc:0 "Airships were mostly novelties up-time, but with the difficulty of heavier-than-air flight, they are becoming quite popular down-time. Their gasbag, filled with hot air, hydrogen, or helium, provides the lifting power, so even heavy, down-time-made engines can be used to propel them through the sky. Airships can be used for transport, but with some modifications, aerial combat and other applications may be possible."
