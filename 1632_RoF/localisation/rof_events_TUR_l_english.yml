 RoF_TUR.100.t:0 "The Regency of Murad IV"
 RoF_TUR.100.d:0 "Sultan Murad has been the official ruler of the Ottoman Empire for nearly 8 years; however, the true power has resided in his mother, Kösem Sultan, and his various viziers. The previous two sultans, Murad's uncle and brother, were both deposed by palace intrigues. Murad must take control of the government if he is going to last longer than they did."
 RoF_TUR.100.a:0 "For the Sultan!"
 RoF_TUR.101.t:0 "Dealing with Hüsrev Pasha"
 RoF_TUR.101.d:0 "Hüsrev Pasha has been the Grand Vizier for three years now, since the previous Grand Vizier failed to put down a rebellion. Hüsrev has been very effective as the Grand Vizier, effectively running the state for the underage Murad. However, his will is not the will of Murad; and his recent failure to retake Baghdad provides Murad an opportunity to replace him. Alternately, we might keep him as the Grand Vizier, but make it clear his responsibilities are being curtailed."
 RoF_TUR.101.a:0 "Hüsrev must go"
 TUR_husrev_dismissed:0 "Hüsrev Pasha has been dismissed"
 RoF_TUR.101.b:0 "Hüsrev will have a second chance"
 TUR_husrev_pasha.TT:0 "§RHüsrev Pasha may decide later that he wants his power back§!"
 TUR_husrev_curtailed:0 "Hüsrev Pasha's authority has been curtailed"
 RoF_TUR.102.t:0 "Ottoman Bureaucracy"
 RoF_TUR.102.d:0 "The Ottoman Empire is a bureaucratic empire, with many scribes and functionaries who keep the machinery of the state running. While they are all servants of the Sultan, there are still factions and politics to negotiate in order for the bureaucracy to operate a peak efficency. Sultan Murad can  deal with the current bureaucrats, or replace any whose loyalty is questionable."
 RoF_TUR.102.a:0 "We need experienced scribes, even if we can't fully trust them."
 RoF_TUR.102.b:0 "We need loyal scribes, even if they will be less effective."
 TUR_new_bureaucrats.TT:0 "The new scribes will eventually become more effective"
 RoF_TUR.103.t:0 "A New Bureaucracy"
 RoF_TUR.103.d:0 "Our new corps of scribes and bureaucrats are now trained well-enough to effectively run our empire again."
 RoF_TUR.103.a:0 "Excellent"
 TUR_new_bureaucrats.TT:0 "The new scribes will eventually become more effective"
 RoF_TUR.104.t:0 "Ottoman Military"
 RoF_TUR.104.d:0 "The Ottoman Military is dominated by the Janissary Corps, the most elite infantry in the world, and the Sipahi, the Ottoman cavalry force. Both branches wield huge amounts of power on and off of the battlefield; an effective sultan must be able to control these soldiers or likely face a coup. The Janissaries are the more immediate concern for Murad's rule."
 RoF_TUR.104.a:0 "We must work with the Corps"
 RoF_TUR.104.b:0 "We must reform the Corps"
 RoF_TUR.105.t:0 "The Valide Sultan"
 RoF_TUR.105.d:0 "Sultan Murad IV now has the support of most of the Ottoman government and military. It is time for Murad's mother, Kösem Sultan, to step aside from her role as regent and support her son. Alternatively, we may force her to retire entirely from court life."
 RoF_TUR.105.a:0 "She will advise us."
 RoF_TUR.105.b:0 "She must retire from public life."
 RoF_TUR.110.t:0 "American Overtures"
 RoF_TUR.110.d:0 "We have received a missive from an oddly named princedom in Germany. This /"New United States/" claims to be from the future. They wish to establish friendly relations with the Empire for mutual benefit. If what they are claiming is true, it could shake the Empire to its very core. The possible advantages are many, but so are the risks."
 RoF_TUR.110.a:0 "We will ignore these charletans, and decree it a falsehood."
 RoF_TUR.110.b:0 "This is the opporunity of the century!"
 RoF_TUR.150.t:0 "Military Reforms"
 RoF_TUR.150.d:0 "It has become clear that the Ottoman military is not as powerful as it once was as evidenced by the losses against Persia in the east in the previous decade. A main cause for this decline is the decadence and corruption of the Janissary and the Sipahi Corps. Any moves to reform our military will have to be taken carefully to avoid goading the soldiers into full rebellion."
 RoF_TUR.150.a:0 "Slow, moderate reforms will be enough for now."
 RoF_TUR.150.b:0 "We must overhaul our army if we wish to keep up with our neighbors."
 RoF_TUR.150.c:0 "Do we really need reforms?"
