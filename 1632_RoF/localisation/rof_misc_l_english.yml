 SWE_RING_OF_FIRE_DESC:0 "Having recently entered the Wars of Religion as the defender of the Protestant faiths, Sweden has enjoyed early victories over the Catholic League and Austria. So far, she have been aided by the Netherlands and France indirectly and by several Protestant German nobles more directly. The arrival of Grantville to Germany will likely upset the balance of the war."
 AUS_RING_OF_FIRE_DESC:0 "Emperor of the Holy Roman Empire, Archduke of Austria, King of Bohemia and Hungary; Austria is caught in the Wars of Religion against the Protestant nobles of Germany to keep their power in the HRE. Although she has the support of their brethern in Spain and many of the Catholic Germans, she is hard pressed after more than a decade of war. Austria must also keep a watchful eye on the Ottoman Empire who would like nothing more than to gobble up central Europe."

Controlling much of North Africa and the Middle East, it recently acquired much of Hungary, standing now on the doorstep of Vienna, the gateway to the rest of Europe.

 SPR_RING_OF_FIRE_DESC:0 "Spain controls the largest Empire in world, stretching from the Phillipines in the East, to Mexico in the West. However, Spain has been fighting a long war against the upstart Dutch, former subjects who revolted several decades ago. The war has been slow for many years, and Spain's involvement in the Wars of Religion has kept much of its forces tied up, but it may be time to make another push."
 UPS_RING_OF_FIRE_DESC:0 "The United Provinces are a relative newcomer to the European stage, but after breaking free of Spanish control, the Dutch have built a prosperous land, even in spite of Spanish military campaigns. The heart of European trade flows through Dutch ports and anyone who wishes to do large business must deal with Dutch banks. The Dutch have supported the Protestant cause in the Wars of Religion, but have been to busy defending against the Spanish to engage directly in the wars."
