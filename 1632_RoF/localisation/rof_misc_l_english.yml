 RING_OF_FIRE_NAME:0 "The Ring of Fire"
 RING_OF_FIRE_DESC:0 "A supernatural event has brought a West Virgina mining town from the year 2000 to central Germany in the year 1631. The arrival of these time-displaced Americans, along with their knowledge and technology has changed the course of history. The Wars of Religion have been ongoing for 15 years and the recent entry of Sweden has invigorated the Protestants. Into this cauldron, come an unlikely set of folk, who may just up-end the entire system."
 NUS_RING_OF_FIRE_DESC:0 "Dropped into the middle of a country at war with itself, the time-displaced Americans will have make a home for themselves. Only time will tell if they will be able to hold back the established powers as they create their own nation"
 SWE_RING_OF_FIRE_DESC:0 "Having recently entered the Wars of Religion as the defender of the Protestant faiths, Sweden has enjoyed early victories over the Catholic League and Austria. So far, she have been aided by the Netherlands and France indirectly and by several Protestant German nobles more directly. The arrival of Grantville to Germany will likely upset the balance of the war."
 AUS_RING_OF_FIRE_DESC:0 "Emperor of the Holy Roman Empire, Archduke of Austria, King of Bohemia and Hungary; Austria is caught in the Wars of Religion against the Protestant nobles of Germany to keep their power in the HRE. Although she has the support of their brethern in Spain and many of the Catholic Germans, she is hard pressed after more than a decade of war. Austria must also keep a watchful eye on the Ottoman Empire who would like nothing more than to gobble up central Europe."
 FRA_RING_OF_FIRE_DESC:0 "France sits between the Habsburg lands of Spain and Austria. She has so far been spared from the Wars of Religion, having only indirectly aided the Protestants, but it may come time to do more to curb Habsburg power."
 TUR_RING_OF_FIRE_DESC:0 "The Ottoman Empire is near its peak. Controlling much of North Africa and the Middle East, it recently acquired much of Hungary, standing now on the doorstep of Vienna, the gateway to the rest of Europe. A war with Safavid Persia has kept its attention in east, but if that can be brought to a swift conclusion, the time may be ripe to strike again at the west."

The Wars of Religion have been ongoing for 15 years and the recent entry of Sweden has invigorated the Protestants. Into this cauldron, come an unlikely set of folk, who may just up-end the entire system."
 SPR_RING_OF_FIRE_DESC:0 "Spain controls the largest Empire in world, stretching from the Phillipines in the East, to Mexico in the West. However, Spain has been fighting a long war against the upstart Dutch, former subjects who revolted several decades ago. The war has been slow for many years, and Spain's involvement in the Wars of Religion has kept much of its forces tied up, but it may be time to make another push."
 UPS_RING_OF_FIRE_DESC:0 "The United Provinces are a relative newcomer to the European stage, but after breaking free of Spanish control, the Dutch have built a prosperous land, even in spite of Spanish military campaigns. The heart of European trade flows through Dutch ports and anyone who wishes to do large business must deal with Dutch banks. The Dutch have supported the Protestant cause in the Wars of Religion, but have been to busy defending against the Spanish to engage directly in the wars."
