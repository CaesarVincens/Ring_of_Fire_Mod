 galleon_desc:0 "The Man-o-War, the Galleon, the Carrack; whatever the name, these ships are large ships built specifically for war. The earliest examples were the treasure ships built to carry gold from the Americas for the Spanish, the Galleon, but soon ships built specifically for war took shape."
 both_frigates_desc:0 "Frigates are lighter-built ships than the Man-o-War, but no less useful. More maneuverable, they quickly became the majority ship of many sailing navies."
 steam_warships_desc:0 "A short-lived phenomenon in the up-time history, Steam Battleships occupied the space between sailing battleships and armored dreadnaughts. Steam power gave them maneuverability no matter the wind, but they are very expensive to maintain."
 steam_frigates_desc:0 "Steam Frigates occupy a similar role as sailing frigates. Lighter ships which are less expensive to operate and build than their larger cousin the battleship, but still formidible in their own right."
 timberclad_desc:0 "Timberclad refers to use of extra thick wooden armor reinforcing the hulls of these ships. While not as much protection as iron or steel, it does a sufficient job against most weapons. Without sails, these ships are generally limited to river and coastal work."
 ironclad_desc:0 "Ironclad ships have heavy armor protecting their freeboard, the hull above water. The use of steam or internal combustion to drive them means not depending on wind for maneuverability, but does limit their effective range."
